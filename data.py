# The following line is an example of how you can add a string (aka text) value to a variable.
exampleVariable = "This is a string added to the variable named exampleVariable"

'''
Explanation:

[variable name] [equal sign] [value]

[variable name]: `exampleVariable`
You can give almost any name to a variable, but be careful with two things:
1. Don't use special characters in it.
2. Use the "snake_case" form where words are separated by underscores, 
   and all letters are in lowercase (e.g., this_is_a_snake_case_text).
   Alternatively, Python also allows "camelCase" like JavaScript, but "snake_case" is more common in Python for variable names.
It is recommended to use the English language throughout your code, especially (but not exclusively) for variable names.

[equal sign]: `=`
Remember, the equal sign between the variable name and the value is crucial.
This serves as the "assignment operator" which assigns the value to the variable.

[value]: `"This is a string added to the variable named exampleVariable"`
The value is the piece of data you want to assign (save) to the variable for later use.

In Python, there's no need for a semicolon at the end of the line.
